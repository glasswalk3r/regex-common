=head1 NAME

Regexp::Common::URI::http -- Returns a pattern for HTTP URIs.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Regexp::Common qw /URI/;

    while (<>) {
        /$RE{URI}{HTTP}/       and  print "Contains an HTTP URI.\n";
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 $RE{URI}{HTTP}{-scheme}

Provides a regex for an HTTP URI as defined by RFC 2396 (generic syntax)
and RFC 2616 (HTTP).

If C<< -scheme => I<P> >> is specified the pattern I<P> is used as the scheme.
By default I<P> is C<qr/http/>. C<https> and C<https?> are reasonable
alternatives.

The syntax for an HTTP URI is:

    "http:" "//" host [ ":" port ] [ "/" path [ "?" query ]]

Under C<{-keep}>, the following are returned:

=over 4

=item $1

The entire URI.

=item $2

The scheme.

=item $3

The host (name or address).

=item $4

The port (if any).

=item $5

The absolute path, including the query and leading slash.

=item $6

The absolute path, including the query, without the leading slash.

=item $7

The absolute path, without the query or leading slash.

=item $8

The query, without the question mark.
