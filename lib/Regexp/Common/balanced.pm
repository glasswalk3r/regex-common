=head1 NAME

Regex::Common::balanced -- provide regexes for strings with balanced
parenthesized delimiters or arbitrary delimiters.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Regex::Common qw /balanced/;

    while (<>) {
        /$RE{balanced}{-parens=>'()'}/
                                   and print q{balanced parentheses\n};
    }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Please consult the manual of L<Regex::Common> for a general description
of the works of this interface.

Do not use this module directly, but load it via I<Regex::Common>.

=head2 C<$RE{balanced}{-parens}>

Returns a pattern that matches a string that starts with the nominated
opening parenthesis or bracket, contains characters and properly nested
parenthesized subsequences, and ends in the matching parenthesis.

More than one type of parenthesis can be specified:

        $RE{balanced}{-parens=>'(){}'}

in which case all specified parenthesis types must be correctly balanced within
the string.

Since version 2013030901, C<< $1 >> will always be set (to the entire
matched substring), regardless whether C<< {-keep} >> is used or not.

=head2 C<< $RE{balanced}{-begin => "begin"}{-end => "end"} >>

Returns a pattern that matches a string that is properly balanced
using the I<begin> and I<end> strings as start and end delimiters.
Multiple sets of begin and end strings can be given by separating
them by C<|>s (which can be escaped with a backslash).

    qr/$RE{balanced}{-begin => "do|if|case"}{-end => "done|fi|esac"}/

will match properly balanced strings that either start with I<do> and
end with I<done>, start with I<if> and end with I<fi>, or start with
I<case> and end with I<esac>.

If I<-end> contains less cases than I<-begin>, the last case of I<-end>
is repeated. If it contains more cases than I<-begin>, the extra cases
are ignored. If either of I<-begin> or I<-end> isn't given, or is empty,
I<< -begin => '(' >> and I<< -end => ')' >> are assumed.

Since version 2013030901, C<< $1 >> will always be set (to the entire
matched substring), regardless whether C<< {-keep} >> is used or not.

=head2 Note

Since version 2013030901 the pattern will make of the recursive construct
C<< (?-1) >>, instead of using the problematic C<< (??{ }) >> construct.
This fixes an problem that was introduced in the 5.17 development track.
