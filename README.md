# The last joke from Perl community

*This repository was suppose to be a fork from the [Regexp::Common](https://metacpan.org/pod/Regexp::Common), since your "majesty" author of this module cannot be
bothered with a simple pull request.*

*But on the other hand, your majesty minions were in the lookout for any person trying to fork such project, which would be absolutely unnaceptable without the
direct approval from your majesty.*

Of course, this could be a just an anecdote, but it isn't. After years contribuiting to the Perl community, in less than 5 hours after I commited a mistake when
publishing to CPAN (which resulted in **nothing** in practical terms), I was accused of "[Licence violation](https://github.com/glasswalk3r/regex-common/issues/1)".

I never received such attention in all those years when trying to help the community.

Congratulations for those involved. I just got tired.

I'm sure the Perl community is doing just **GREAT** nowadays, with thousands of new programmers joining their ranks and fighting each other for the chance to
contribute to the community.

That being said, they really look as not in need of anybody's help, mine included.

I'm out of here. I'm not the first one leaving, neither will be the last.
